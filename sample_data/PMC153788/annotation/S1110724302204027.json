The HR frequency can be assessed by selecting for the recombined antibiotic resistance gene in a colony formation assay (eg, GPT), or by assaying the marker gene product such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) via flow cytometry (FACS). (b) Integration-associated HR [18]. The linearized substrates p\u03942 and p\u03943, each carrying a mutated GPT gene copy (black boxes, gene deletions), are cotransfected. HR before and during plasmid integration leads to the reconstitution of the resistance gene. Drug selection is used for isolation of stable recombinants in a colony formation assay. (c) Homologous gene targeting [29]. Linearized p\u03942puro is stably integrated using puromycin. Transient transfection of p\u03943 allows for HR between the chromosomal GPT gene copy and the extrachromosomal GPT. The reconstituted GPT gene is selected for using colony formation. (d) Episomal HR with replication [30]. An episomally replicating recombination substrate carrying mutated tandem repeats of a CAT reporter is transiently transfected together with an I-SceI expression vector. Breaks are generated within one CAT copy (black insertion) and repaired via HR using a downstream homologous template. After 48 hours, episomal plasmids are extracted and tested for the functional CAT gene in a bacterial shuttle vector assay. (e) Extrachromosomal HR. The mutated recombination substrate (CAT or Luciferase gene) is cut prior to transfection. HR reconstitutes the gene function, which can be measured by assaying cell extracts in a luminometer or scintillation counter.", "sub-caption text": "", "path-to-media": "sample_data/PMC153788images/20402.fig.001a.jpg"}, "18": {"type": "Table", "number": "1:", "subnumber": "", "caption_text": "&-$StartT1$-Table 1: : Typical limitations to the use of I-SceI based plasmid assays for assessment of chromosomal DSB repair$EndT1$.", "sub-caption text": ""}}}
