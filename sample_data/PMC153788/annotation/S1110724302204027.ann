T3	Reference 6619 6832	However, it has not yet been established whether and how ATM and p53 influence the repair of the I-SceI breaks.Several important technical caveats should be considered when utilizing the I-SceI system (Figure 1a).

T4	Reference 10547 10903	Consequentially, such an approach would involve variably cut extrachromosomal repair substrates, as no alternative to I-SceI generated chromosomal breaks is yet available.Plasmid assays containing extrachromosomal componentsThe role of ATM for extrachromosomal and integration-associated HR was investigated in our laboratory by Luo et al (Figure 1b) [18].

T5	Reference 11514 11940	One conclusion derived from these data was that if the DNA termini are within or close to the recombination substrate, then the high frequency of extrachromosomal recombination in AT cells is offset by mis-repair of the recombining sequences.Figure 1c illustrates an assay modification, which utilizes stable chromosomal integration of pΔ2puro at a random site, transient transfection of pΔ3 and selection of gpt recombinants.

T6	Reference 12213 12499	The results of this assay are consistent with other reports showing reduced homologous gene targeting in cells lacking BRCA2 or BRCA1 [16, 17].Purely extrachromosomal HR, that is, in the absence of any integration step, can be assessed by employing episomal shuttle vectors (Figure 1d).

T7	Reference 12822 13205	Figure 1e illustrates a rapid plasmid reactivation assay which employs CAT or Luciferase reporters; however, it is unclear what the genetic determinants of this endpoint are.Translational research in the postgenome era may ultimately involve routine characterization of repair phenotypes in primary fibroblasts or tumor cells directly taken from patients with known genetic profiles.

T8	Reference 13951 14217	At this stage of research, it appears that purely extrachromosomal HR proceeds independently of p53, at least in murine fibroblasts [30]; thus necessitating the use of integration-linked assays for analysis of p53-dependent HR (Figures 1b, #F1-9#-1c, and #F2-10#-2).

T12	Caption 9667 9943	Typical limitations to the utilization of complex repair assays such as the I-SceI system are displayed in Table 1.Induction of chromosomal breaks by the I-SceI endonuclease generates a 4 bp staggered cut that leaves free 3′ hydroxy overhangs, which can be directly religated.
