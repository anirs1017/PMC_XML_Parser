T1	Caption 0 0	Figure 1 Illustration of the principles of measuring HR with plasmid assays. (a) Chromosomal DSB repair assay [14, 15]. A linearized plasmid substrate containing mutated resistance or marker genes is transfected and stable chromosomal integrants are selected, for example, using a puromycin resistance gene. Single-cell derived or pooled populations are amplified, and the integrated plasmid is characterized. Single or multiple copy integrants can be processed. The I-SceI expression vector is transiently transfected and usually 48 hours are allowed for the generation and homology-directed repair of I-SceI breaks within the integrated substrate (black insertion). The HR frequency can be assessed by selecting for the recombined antibiotic resistance gene in a colony formation assay (eg, GPT), or by assaying the marker gene product such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) via flow cytometry (FACS). (b) Integration-associated HR [18]. The linearized substrates pΔ2 and pΔ3, each carrying a mutated GPT gene copy (black boxes, gene deletions), are cotransfected. HR before and during plasmid integration leads to the reconstitution of the resistance gene. Drug selection is used for isolation of stable recombinants in a colony formation assay. (c) Homologous gene targeting [29]. Linearized pΔ2puro is stably integrated using puromycin. Transient transfection of pΔ3 allows for HR between the chromosomal GPT gene copy and the extrachromosomal GPT. The reconstituted GPT gene is selected for using colony formation. (d) Episomal HR with replication [30]. An episomally replicating recombination substrate carrying mutated tandem repeats of a CAT reporter is transiently transfected together with an I-SceI expression vector. Breaks are generated within one CAT copy (black insertion) and repaired via HR using a downstream homologous template. After 48 hours, episomal plasmids are extracted and tested for the functional CAT gene in a bacterial shuttle vector assay. (e) Extrachromosomal HR. The mutated recombination substrate (CAT or Luciferase gene) is cut prior to transfection. HR reconstitutes the gene function, which can be measured by assaying cell extracts in a luminometer or scintillation counter.

T4	Reference 10481 10837	Consequentially, such an approach would involve variably cut extrachromosomal repair substrates, as no alternative to I-SceI generated chromosomal breaks is yet available.Plasmid assays containing extrachromosomal componentsThe role of ATM for extrachromosomal and integration-associated HR was investigated in our laboratory by Luo et al (Figure 1b) [18].

T5	Reference 11428 11854	One conclusion derived from these data was that if the DNA termini are within or close to the recombination substrate, then the high frequency of extrachromosomal recombination in AT cells is offset by mis-repair of the recombining sequences.Figure 1c illustrates an assay modification, which utilizes stable chromosomal integration of pD2puro at a random site, transient transfection of pD3 and selection of gpt recombinants.

There is an area of shared homology of approximately 400 bp. Experiments were carried out with cleavage at a distance from the gene, that is, EcoRI, or within the gene, that is, KpnI. See [18] for details. Homology-mediated recombination and gpt gene restoration can occur before, during, or shortly after chromosomal plasmid integration. Cellular resistance to XHATM is selected for after 48 hours.

T14	Caption 0 0	Figure 3 Illustration of the principles of measuring NHEJ with plasmid assays. (a) Physical analysis of chromosomal NHEJ. Analogous to Figure #F1-16#-1a, I-SceI breaks are generated in an integrated HR substrate, but cells are plated without selection antibiotic. Colonies are analyzed on a clone by clone basis for an NHEJ product using Southern blot and PCR. Alternatively, PCR of genomic DNA can be used for semiquantitative analysis of NHEJ [16]. (b) Random plasmid integration [29, 31]. The transfection frequency of a linearized reporter plasmid as a measure of NHEJ is scored by selecting for the intact resistance gene, for example, with puromycin. (c) Extrachromosomal rejoining assay [32]. A Luciferase expression plasmid is cleaved between the promoter and the reporter gene prior to the transient transfection. In the cell, Luciferase can only be expressed following NHEJ and re-circularization of the plasmid. Cell extracts are assayed for Luciferase activity. (d) Episomal V(D)J recombination [34]. Analogous to Figure #F1-17#-1d, recombination signal sequences flank a bacterial transcription stop signal upstream of a CAT reporter. The plasmid is cotransfected with Rag1/Rag2 expression vectors. The cleavage of the signal sequences followed by site-specific recombination removes the transcription stop signal, so that extracted plasmids can be assessed for CAT resistance in a bacterial shuttle vector assay.
