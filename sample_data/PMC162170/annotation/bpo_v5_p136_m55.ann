T1	Caption 0 0	Fig. 1 The difference in measured fluorescence intensity of DAF-2 alone or after reaction with NO released from endothelial cells becomes more significant with lower DAF-2 concentrations.Blank vials (white bars) or EA.hy 926 cells (black bars) were incubated with PBS supplemented with 100 uM of L-arginine for 5 min at 37degC in the dark.Then DAF-2 at the indicated concentrations and the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 uM) were added.5 min later.The fluorescence of the supernatants was measured as described in Materials and Methods.All data are mean +- S.D.(n = 2 in triplicate).Differences between means were analyzed using Student's t-test.*P< 0.05; **P< 0.01.

T2	Reference 7075 7407	These theoretic considerations were demonstrated experimentally, as shown in Figure 1: We employed increasing concentrations of DAF-2 (0.01-5 uM in PBS) to either a blank vial (no NO source) or to A23187-activated human endothelial EA.hy926 cells (low-output NO source) followed by fluorescence measurement (lex 495 nm, lem 515 nm).

T3	Caption 0 0	Fig. 2 A: Dependency of fluorescence intensity on the concentration of DAF-2T. DAF-2T was added to PBS in the concentrations as indicated and fluorescence of the solution was determined. (n=4) Y=59.71x+0.466; R2=0.9997. B: Dependency of the fluorescence intensity on the concentration of NO in the presence of cells. EA.hy926 cells were grown to confluence, washed with PBS and incubated for 5 min in PBS supplemented with 100 µM L-arginine. Then 0.1 µM of DAF-2 and the indicated concentrations of the NO-donor NOC-9 were added. After 5 min reaction time in the dark at 37°C the fluorescence was measured. Auto-fluorescence of DAF-2 in cell supernatants without NOC-9 was subtracted. (n=6). Y=0.2714x-0.2947; R2=0.9981

T4	Reference 7717 8363	This suggests that concentrations < 1 uM DAF-2 should be employed measuring NO released from cNOS systems.In order to proof that concentrations < 1 uM DAF-2 are sufficient to trap all NO released from endothelial cells and that the correlation between NO concentration and measured fluorescence intensity is linear we created two standard curves: one for the fluorescence intensity obtained from increasing amounts of DAF-2T (Fig. 2A) and another one correlating increasing NO concentrations (liberated by the NO donor NOC-9 (22) in the presence of EA.hy 926 cells) to the fluorescence intensity measured after addition of 0.1 uM DAF-2 (Fig. 2B).

T6	Caption 0 0	Fig. 3 A: Spectra of DAF-2T obtained by excitating at different wavelength (480-495 nm): Cells were grown to confluence and stimulated with PMA 2 nM for 18 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS and supplemented with L-arginine (100 uM) and kept in the dark (5 min, 37degC).Thereafter, DAF-2 (0.1 uM) and A23187 (1 uM) were added for 5 min in the dark at 37degC.Spectra of supernatants were measured at different excitation wavelength.B: Spectra were measured at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm with different concentrations of NO liberated from the NO-donor NOC-9.

T7	Reference 12399 12667	Since the excitation maximum of DAF-2T is at 495 nm and the emission maximum at 515 nm, in instruments with low resolutions, the shoulder of the peak caused by Rayleigh light scatter (495 nm) may overlap with the maximum of the DAF-2T emission peak (515 nm) (Fig. 3A).

T8	Reference 12881 13088	However, as can be seen in Figure 3A, leaving the DAF-2T absorbance maximum (495 nm) for excitation the measured emission fluorescence intensity becomes smaller and thus the detection limit for NO increases.
