T2	Reference 7124 7456	These theoretic considerations were demonstrated experimentally, as shown in Figure 1: We employed increasing concentrations of DAF-2 (0.01-5 µM in PBS) to either a blank vial (no NO source) or to A23187-activated human endothelial EA.hy926 cells (low-output NO source) followed by fluorescence measurement (λex 495 nm, λem 515 nm).

T3	Reference 7465 7766	Figure 1 shows that the fluorescence intensity obtained from DAF-2/DAF-2T in the supernatants of NO-producing endothelial cells does not exceed significantly the level of the fluorescence intensity obtained from DAF-2 auto-flourescence (no NO source) when concentrations of DAF-2 > 1 µM were employed.

T4	Caption 7775 8428	This suggests that concentrations < 1 µM DAF-2 should be employed measuring NO released from cNOS systems.In order to proof that concentrations < 1 µM DAF-2 are sufficient to trap all NO released from endothelial cells and that the correlation between NO concentration and measured fluorescence intensity is linear we created two standard curves: one for the fluorescence intensity obtained from increasing amounts of DAF-2T (Fig. 2A) and another one correlating increasing NO concentrations (liberated by the NO donor NOC-9 (22) in the presence of EA.hy 926 cells) to the fluorescence intensity measured after addition of 0.1 µM DAF-2 (Fig. #F2-3#-2B).

T6	Reference 8437 8608	As shown in Figure 2, employing up to 100 nM NOC-9 (corresponding to 200 nM NO) the correlation between NO concentration and fluorescence intensity is linear (r2 = 0.997).

T8	Reference 12534 12802	Since the excitation maximum of DAF-2T is at 495 nm and the emission maximum at 515 nm, in instruments with low resolutions, the shoulder of the peak caused by Rayleigh light scatter (495 nm) may overlap with the maximum of the DAF-2T emission peak (515 nm) (Fig. 3A).

T9	Reference 13027 13234	However, as can be seen in Figure 3A, leaving the DAF-2T absorbance maximum (495 nm) for excitation the measured emission fluorescence intensity becomes smaller and thus the detection limit for NO increases.
