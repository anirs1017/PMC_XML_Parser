Pseudomonas beads instillation is associated with the development of a chronic infection
Clinically, a major weight loss was observed from the second day in P. aeruginosa beads infected animals compared to the sterile beads groups (Figure 1).

Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage All the animals who received sterile beads were included in the sterile group and compared to the control and pneumonic groups at respectively 2, 5, 8, 15 and 21 days post instillation.

Histologically, in the infected groups, from the 2nd day, large numbers of PMNs were observed, mostly centered on the alveoli (Figure 2C–D).

As shown in Table 2, no difference in wet to dry lung weight ratio was observed between the groups.
