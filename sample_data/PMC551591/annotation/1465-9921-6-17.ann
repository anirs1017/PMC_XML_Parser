T1	Caption 15625 15857	Table 1 Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage All the animals who received sterile beads were included in the sterile group and compared to the control and pneumonic groups at respectively 2, 5, 8, 15 and 21 days post instillation.

T3	Caption 0 575	Figure 2 Histological analysis of the different groups, controls and sterile beads instilled animals are compared to pneumonic rats from the second to the 21st day post instillation. Coloration was performed with Hematoxyline-Eosine-Safran. A: Control group; B: Sterile beads; C-D: Pneumonia on the 2nd day (the arrow on panel D underlines infected beads); E-F: Pneumonia on the 5th day; G-H: Pneumonia on the 8th day; I-J: Pneumonia on the 15th day; K-L: Pneumonia on the 21st day.

T7	Caption 0 575	Figure 4 Evaluation of DAFC in the control compared to the pneumonic groups on the fifth day post instillation at baseline and after stimulation with terbutaline. A last group received terbutaline after bacterial eradication with ceftazidime administered intraperitoneally. None of the pneumonic groups could increase DAFC after either stimulation or bacterial eradication. Footnote: Data are mean (Â± SD). Comparisons between groups were made using analysis of variance with post hoc for multiple comparisons. *p < 0.05, statistically different from the control group. DAFC: distal alveolar fluid clearance. Ctr: Control group, Terbut: Control instilled with terbutaline (10-4 M), St + Terbut: Sterile beads instilled with terbutaline (10-4 M), Cefta + Terbut: Control group treated with ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/8 h for 72 h) and instilled with terbutaline (10-4 M), Pn5: Pneumonic group on the 5th day, Pn5 + Terbut: Pneumonic group on the 5th day instilled with terbutaline (10-4 M), Pn5 + Terbut IP: Pneumonic group on the 5th day with an intraperitoneal injection of terbutaline, Pn5 + Cefta+ Terbut: Pneumonic group on the 5th day treated with ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/8 h for 72 h) instilled with terbutaline (10-4 M).
