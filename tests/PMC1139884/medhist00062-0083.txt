DR MARC D'ESPINE'S STATISTICAL NOSOLOGY

by

F. M. M. LEWES*

THE BACKGROUND

Nosologies, lists of diseases or causes of death, have been compiled from quite early
times, usually in connection with medical research or teaching. The one illustrated and
discussed here was constructed in Geneva by Dr Marc d'Espine during the first half of
the nineteenth century for "statistical" purposes, that is, for the analysis of causes of
death as registered in the Canton. In its time it was of some importance, for it was one
of the two contenders for use as an international standard which were offered to the
International Statistical Congress, which held nine meetings between 1853 and 1876.
The other nosology was that presented by the Englishman William Farr.

Jacob Marc d'Espine was born in Geneva on 29 April 1806,' but his family later
moved to Odessa.2 From there he went in 1826 to Paris to study medicine, remaining
until 1833.3 Afterwards he acknowledged his debt to two of the great Parisian teachers
of the time: Gabriel Andral (1797-1872) and, more particularly, Pierre-Charles Louis
(1787-1872). Indeed, in 1832, he was one of six Genevans among the thirteen members
of Louis's 'Societe Medicale d'Observation'4 devoted to the study of disease by
"numerical analysis". Farr, who was nineteen months Marc d'Espine's junior, was
coincidently in Paris between 1830 and 1832 and mentions the same teachers.

In the late 1830s both men were independently analysing information on causes of
death; and in the first account of his work, each explained how he had found existing
nosologies unsatisfactory and had to construct one for himself.5 At the time they were
the only two men in Europe carrying out such a task and both continued to do it
successfully for many years. Others had tried and failed. As early as 1764, Frederick II
of Prussia, prompted by Siissmilch,6 had such an exercise initiated, using fifty-six causes of

death, but had soon abandoned it. As late as 1831, the Swedish registration system
gave up recording causes of death, apart from four specific causes, because of the
unreliability of the information as reported by the clergy.7 Both Marc d'Espine and
Farr were breaking new ground and although their results differed, one must not
overlook the magnitude and importance of their achievement.

Marc d'Espine's work was restricted to the small canton of Geneva, but it was not
unknown elsewhere, nor did he labour in isolation. There survive seventeen letters he
wrote between 1845 and his death in 1860 to Adolphe Quetelet, the famous Belgian
astronomer and founder of the International Statistical Congress.8 Louis-Rene
Villerme, a well-known French writer on the effects of industrialization, presented a
paper for him in Paris.9 Marc d'Espine continued to correspond with his former
teacher Pierre-Charles Louis.10 Mullener attributes twenty-six publications to
him.11

In 1839, Farr published an analysis of causes of death based on the first six months of
civil registration of deaths in England and Wales, that is from July to December 1837.12
The following year saw Marc d'Espine's first report.'3 It was, of course, on a far
smaller scale: 1,323 deaths in a year in Geneva, against a hundred times that many in
six months in England and Wales. In an appendix, he commented on the start of
registration in England and Wales: "an immense step forward and one which does
them the greatest credit". After summarizing Farr's results, he gave details of the
nosological classification used, and criticized its main division of diseases into
"epidemic" and "sporadic", preferring instead that of "acute" and "chronic".
Nevertheless, he concluded that England could not have made "a better choice of a
doctor to establish a statistical nosology than someone as enlightended as Dr Farr".

Farr replied promptly in a long footnote in the next Annual report of the
Registrar-General.'4 He described Marc d'Espine's work approvingly, but rebutted his
criticisms of the nosology. Finally he suggested that should France start collecting
information on causes of death, they could find no one better qualified to analyse it
than Marc d'Espine. After this exchange each continued to use his own nosology,
although when Farr revised his in 1842, he seems to have noted some of Marc
d'Espine's suggestions, notably that tubercular diseases should form a single group,
irrespective of site. On the other hand, he remained firmly opposed to the
acute/chronic division. Marc d'Espine continued annual analyses with minor changes,

but publication was sporadic.15 They took the form of large, poster-sized sheets, like
that illustrated here (see fig. 1, insert), although that for 1844-5 included an
explanatory booklet in which he again complained about Farr's system. There is
evidence that they exchanged publications.'6

In September 1853, the two men met in Brussels at the first Session of the
International Statistical Congress. "Cause of death" was not specifically on the
agenda, although Marc d'Espine had written about the subject to Quetelet, who
organized the session and its agenda.17 However, Congress passed a resolution that
"there is a need to formulate a uniform nomenclature of causes of death which would
be applied in all countries. This nomenclature, whose importance cannot be
exaggerated, will be the subject of future studies and will be agreed at the next
Congress".'8 The two men were asked to agree upon and present a solution.

At that time Farr was well advanced in the preparation of a revised nosology which
appeared in 1856 in the Sixteenth annual report, relating to 1853. He presented this to
Congress with a long, similarly classified list of illnesses not normally fatal. This
new nosology differed considerably from the earlier ones, but conceded nothing to
Marc d'Espine's acute/chronic distinction. Marc d'Espine's contribution differed little
from that presented in this article. Both forms were put before the Paris Congress in
1855 because, as the Commission organisatrice cynically remarked, "As perhaps could
easily have been predicted, the two learned Doctors, having exchanged a certain
number of written communications between London and Geneva, had to renounce
any hope of agreement."'9

However disagreement was not total. The "nomenclature," that is, the names by
which the diseases were to be known, was agreed during the Session, and aided by
Doctors Rayer, Bertini, Virchow, Meding and Hubertz, Marc d'Espine and Farr
presented a concordance of 139 names of diseases in Latin, French,
Italian, English, German, Swedish and Danish. The list was "classified" in the sense
that it grouped causes of death roughly, but not in accordance with either of the two
proposals: its two main classes were "well-defined diseases" and "incompletely-
defined diseases". Congress left the choice of classification system unresolved.

The next session took place in Vienna in 1857. It seems probable that the Tableau
presented here was intended as a contribution. The Austrian Preparatory Commission
presented a paper which took neither side. Indeed they avoided the issue, or perhaps
did not understand it. The matter was discussed fairly briefly. Marc d'Espine was not
there, possibly because of illness, and Farr forebore to press the point. It must be
admitted that at both Paris and Vienna there was considerable opposition to the

desirability, or even possibility, of a standard list of causes of death. Some doctors
present argued that statisticians had no right to dictate to medical men; that even a
purely medical congress would find it impossible to agree on such a list; and that it
would be an obstacle to progress and an infringement of their freedom to name diseases
as they chose. Again Congress reached no conclusion.

After the Vienna Session, presumably because the issue was still open, Marc
d'Espine wrote an entire book to support his case.20 In the introduction he gave three
main reasons for writing. First, he pressed the need for 'me'decins verifcateurs'to check
the causes of death entered by general practitioners. Second, he argued again for his
nosology. Third, he tried to combat "the doubts manifested by some members [of
Congress] of both the possibility and utility of the enquiry". He also pointed out that,
however carefully observations were made in hospitals, as in Paris, or by general
practitioners, they could not be compared with the total population at risk and
therefore would not reveal aetiological factors. He hoped that his book would show
that this information had already proved useful and important. The book is rather
wordy but presents what is, given the limitations of the data, a remarkable analysis of
causes of death and their background. The Tableau discussed here is dated earlier and
bibliographers normally list it separately, but it may also be found folded in a
back-cover pocket in copies of the book, which was presumably intended as a
contribution to the Congress's fourth session in London in July 1860. Farr organized
its agenda, but omitted cause of death, explaining that this had already been discussed
sufficiently. In the event, this did not matter, as Marc d'Espine had died on 15 March
1860, four months before the session opened.

The International Statistical Congress held another five full sessions before its
sudden collapse in 1878, but the subject of a standard international nosology was never
raised again. Farr presumably felt it unnecessary to re-open the issue and no one else
thought fit to challenge a system which was working well in Britain and was gradually
spreading, if with considerable amendment, to other countries.

THE DOCUMENT

The Tableau in which the nosology appeared is reproduced as figure 1 (insert).2' As
the history above has shown, it was the last of a series of similar tables, although this
1854-55 one was for a particular purpose. It is a handsome document, measuring
633mm by 944mm, possibly intended for display22 and probably produced by
lithography. The top section, about a fifth of the whole, contains three elements: the
title, describing its purpose and Marc d'Espine's qualifications for the task; the
Explication (appendix A); and six subsidiary tables. These cover: the population at the

census of 1843 and projected to 18 5 5, births, marriages, the weather in 1 8 54 and 18 5 5, and
the surface areas of various parts of the Canton.

The main section, below this, is not a conventional table but a statistical worksheet. At
the left margin is a list of causes of death classified according to Marc d'Espine's
nosology. In the centre are twenty-four columns, one for each month of the two-year
period 1854-1855. In the spaces representing each combination of cause of death and
month are symbols, one for each death recorded, showing the characteristics of the
deceased. The system is explained in the Explication (appendix A). In this way it is
possible to discover, for any death, its cause and the aetiological factors: the
month of occurrence, and the age, sex, residence (urban or rural), and occasionally
relative affluence of the deceased. At the right margin and underneath the table, are,
finally, the totals from the rows and columns of symbols. Curiously, the row totals are
given for individual causes of death only. Despite the grouping of causes used in the
nosology, there is no attempt at aggregation.

It is clear from its title that this presentation formed part of Marc d'Espine's
submission. Individual details for each death were given because, as he wrote in the
explanation, this "facilitated the derivation of all imaginable secondary tables". He
presumably used this layout to construct the tables in his own book, but this option was
also available for others.

The Tableau can be criticized for its rigidity. It would be difficult to use if replicated
many times, as Marc d'Espine suggested for larger countries, or divided, as it would need
to be if information were presented for a number of small areas within a country rather
than with the broad urban/rural division indicated here. It would seem impractical to
introduce such new forms of personal classification as occupation, the effect of which
Farr was already investigating.

We do not know much about the ways in which large amounts of data were handled in
the days before mechanical counting machines. Sheets ofthis size were certainly used and,
as Marc d'Espine himself showed in the Essai analytique, analyses of remarkable
complexity could be made. The system itself had been used for many years, and must
therefore have seemed satisfactory for a population the size of Geneva's. The Tableau is
ingenious and elegant, although possibly expensive to print. It was certainly admired and
used by contemporaries.

In the Explication, Marc d'Espine also mentions that each death was classified on the
basis of two reports, one from the deceased's own doctor and one from a "visiting"
doctor. Both at the Congress and in his writing he insisted on the need for such
verification. The small numbers of deaths in Geneva and the opportunity to discuss
individual cases no doubt revealed how often disagreements took place. Marc d'Espine
was therefore not proposing merely a nosology, but also a system of gathering
information on cause of death and a form of presentation which would facilitate its
analysis.

THE NOSOLOGY

The "numerical method" practised in Paris was confined to information on hospital
patients and therefore needed large institutions. These did not exist in "little" Geneva,23

23 Ackerknecht and Buess, op. cit., note 3 above, p. 54.

305

F. M. M. Lewes

so Marc d'Espine turned to the population as a whole. The registration system in
Geneva, established over three hundred years earlier, worked well, although it made no
direct provision for recording causes of death. As mentioned above, Marc d'Espine
obtained these by getting two reports on each death registered, one from the deceased's
practitioner and another from a "visiting doctor". In a town the size of Geneva, with
about 1500 deaths a year, it was possible to discuss individual cases and indeed to
involve his colleagues in the construction of a nosology. In this way, the nomenclature
of causes was allowed to evolve without any predetermined doctrine.24 He himself tells
us that he was at first reluctant to formalise his system, preferring to let it develop in
response to medical needs. He was later to write, however, that "the nomenclature of
fatal diseases must be set up in advance and known to all doctors".25 In the event, the
classification grew from an initial 90 items to 143 items in 1855.

Farr's situation differed greatly. We do not know exactly when he was appointed,
but on arrival in the General Register Office, or soon after, he must have been faced
with a great mass of certificates (150,000 in the first six months) on which causes of
death, sometimes diagnosed by a doctor, sometimes guessed by an informant, were
entered. His first hurried attempt to sort these into a systematic nosology was soon
replaced when, after discussion with the medical profession, a more considered version
was constructed. Fifteen years later a third version, the result of increased experience
and medical knowledge, was introduced and this was the one presented to the
International Statistical Congress. Towards the end of his forty-year tenure of office he
experimented with a fourth, based on the ideas of the Royal College of Physicians.26
Once in use, a nosology was seldom subject to major amendment. With over 300,000
deaths a year, the practical problems of training and overseeing coding clerks were
immense.

It will now be useful to follow Congress's example and consider separately the
'nomenclature', or terminology used, and the 'classification' or method of grouping.
Full details of the former are in figure 2 and appendix B. At the Paris session of 1855, as
mentioned above, doctors from six countries were able to agree on this nomenclature
in their various languages. They seem to have worked primarily on the basis of the
Geneva list-most of the doctors present probably found Marc d'Espine's French
more familiar that Farr's English, and thought Marc d'Espine the more qualified of
the two. The fact that this degree of agreement was possible suggests that the Genevan
and English terminologies were reasonably compatible and made sense to doctors
elsewhere. They contained roughly the same number of entries. Indeed the words used
by Marc d'Espine, while sometimes old-fashioned, are seldom obscure even today.

306

Dr Marc d'Espine's statistical nosology

There is one general difference in the terminology, namely Marc d'Espine's use of
two- and three-word entries, against Farr's single word ones. Sometimes this is difficult
to explain. Why "tetanos spontane" and "epistaxis en particulier" when no other forms
of te'tanos or epistaxis are listed? In other instances, Marc d'Espine's terminology
seems to reflect his ideas. Thus, by making the primary distinction between "chronic"
and "acute" in the classification, he was forced to use these words in many of his
entries. However, it is probably correct to say that, with possible minor exceptions,
both tables contain all the main causes of death as distinguished at the time, without
redundant entries. Differences in the number of entries used, and the form they took,
seem to have arisen from the classification systems used, from differences in the
characters of the two men and from the systems whereby the information on cause of
death was collected. Fifteen years of experience indicated that in both places doctors
were able to supply information on what caused their patients to die in a form which
could be entered into the respective nosologies. Doctors present at the Congress
suggested that this was true elsewhere, in towns if not in the country. Despite the minor
differences in terminology, it was therefore possible for a group of doctors, led by Marc
d'Espine and Farr, to put an agreed nomenclature before the Congress for its approval.
It was Marc D'Espine who presented this and moved its adoption.

The classification was a different matter, for here the two nosologies differed widely
Marc d'Espine proposed grouping causes of death in eight primary classes (see
appendix B for details):

I     Still births

II    Indeterminate deaths
III   Violent deaths

IV    Deaths by morbid accidents
V     Deaths from acute diseases

VI    Deaths from chronic diseases
VII   Congenital malformations
VIII Old age

There was no real difficulty with groups I, II, III, VII, or VIII. It was in the field of
"morbid causes" that the differences lay. Part III of the Essai analytique, which is
devoted to these, gives a clear account of Marc d'Espine's views. "The duration" he
wrote "and the nature-simple inflammation or specific-of morbid causes of death
are the two ideas upon which my whole classification of fatal diseases depends".27
"Duration" he divided into three types: deaths from morbid accidents, that is sudden
but not violent deaths (group IV); deaths from acute diseases (group V); and deaths
from chonic diseases (group VI). He defines "acute" as lasting "several hours, days or
weeks" and "chronic" as "some months or years".

Marc d'Espine adhered firmly to this primary system of classification by duration.
Muillener suggests this was Genevan practice.28 "The first question-how did this
death occur? accident? accident-like occurrence? acute or chronic sickness?"

Interestingly, W. P. Alison, a Scottish doctor, made a similar proposal when criticizing
Farr's first nosology. Mullener points out that until 1800 most Genevan doctors had
trained in Edinburgh, and that Genevan medicine in Marc d'Espine's time was a
"synthesis of Anglo-Saxon and French ideas".

Dr Marc d'Espine's statistical nosology

Acute and chronic diseases were further sub-divided according to the system shown
in figure 2. One sub-group is common to both acute and chronic diseases. This is
"inflammations" which are "diseases peculiar to each of the functions or parts of the
body ... and which a mechanical or chemical irritation can reproduce artificially".
These "have as many forms as there are functions or organs". In the classification,
there are twenty-two acute, and twenty-seven chronic inflammations. Each relates to a
separate function or organ of the body, altough this is often specified through the name
of the disease, for example "nephritis" rather than "inflammation of the kidneys."

The other large sub-group in the group of acute diseases is called "specific diseases".
Marc d'Espine explained that "it is impossible to reproduce these by irriation". This
sub-group is sub-divided in turn. Most of the "specific acute diseases", (twenty-one out
of twenty-eight) are entitled "miasmatic, infectious and contagious"; these are
essentially the "infective and parasitic diseases" of the present international
classification. Both Marc d'Espine and Farr had very similar lists in this section. Farr
called such diseases "epidemic, endemic and contagious" in his submission to the Paris
meeting. This was the era of the great miasma controversy, when the ways in which
these diseases were caused and spread were hotly debated. In their nosologies, both
men seem to have avoided committing themselves.29 Besides this large sub-division
within "specific acute diseases", Marc d'Espine had two smaller ones: "constitutional"
and "virulent". There is also a small sub-group of "special acute diseases", mainly
concerned with childbirth.

Among chronic diseases, those not subsumed as inflammations, namely the
"chronic defects or dispositions", were divided into nine sub-divisions, starting with
the "scrophulous", "tuberculous", and "cancerous". These pathological conditions
are recognized, broadly speaking, today. Within each sub-group the diseases listed
mainly relate to site. A rather unexpected entry is "chronic poisons". Curiously, the
Essai mentioned one further type, "psoric [itches] and herpetic" (psorique et
herpetique), not included in the Tableau.

In describing his system, Marc d'Espine made a number of comments which help to
explain why he and Farr came to adopt such different methods of classification. For
Marc d'Espine, both "epidemic, endemic and contagious diseases" and the "site"
played a minor role, because his Paris training in pathological anatomy had led him to
concentrate on pathological aspects. In the Essai analytique he wrote that it was
"impossible to find a differential element more important pathologically, more in
accord with modern medical philosophy and at the same time more discriminating,
more practical, more easily applied and more favourable to aetiological research than
that which I have adopted for dividing acute diseases into two groups".30 Commenting
on the figures for 1844-5, he stated that "General causes act differently according to
the nature of the disease rather than according to the organs affected." He particuarly
objected to the use of "epidemic" or "sporadic" as a form of classification, writing that
one must not "attribute in advance and irrevocably to every disease an epidemic or
sporadic label without knowing whether one day a certain disease, whether acute or

29 Eyler, op. cit., note 26 above, ch. 5, discusses Farr's views on this.

chronic, will not be found to be epidemic in a certain country under certain conditions
but sporadic in another country where these conditions do not apply"..3'

For Farr the priorities were quite different. Of his "epidemic, endemic and
contagious", or "zymotic", diseases he wrote in his first 'Letter' to the Registrar-
General that they were "the index of salubrity", and that of "the utility of keeping this
class of disease distinct in a practical sanatory report there can be no question".32 In
submitting his proposed nosology to the Paris meeting he commented at length: "They
decimate armies, they destroy fleets, in ravaging prisons they kill men who often justice
has not condemned", but essentially "they are. . . in some way under public control
and it is possible to arrest their development by a combination of well-conceived
sanitary measures."33 For Mullener, Farr's nosology was "for studying public health",
Marc d'Espine's was a "research instrument".34 Despite the latter's claim in the
Explication to have based his classification on aetiological principles, the classification
was essentially pathological. The difference of opinion stemmed from a fundamental
difference of approach and was never resolved.

Marc d'Espine and Farr had both given much thought to the systems they were
proposing, and which had been in use in their countries with worthwhile results for
many years. Both nosologies contain quirks, but each was governed by a sound
internal logic. The differences were very clear to the two men, but less so to others, even
in Paris where the local organizers did not provide an agenda paper themselves,
although they were shortly to publish some statistics based on their own nosology.35 At
the Vienna session there was great confusion. One can wonder whether, if Marc
d'Espine's system had been chosen, it would have survived the changes which were to
come in medical knowledge. One cannot deny that it was a serious contender for
submission to the Congress.

THE AFTERMATH

Although the International Statistical Congress did not discuss nosologies after
Marc d'Espine's death, the publicity the debate had caused amongst statisticians, and
the general recognition of the need for better information for medical and
public-health purposes, led to the collection of cause-of-death statistics in a growing
number of countries. The difficulties which arose were seldom those of classification.
Around 1860, the very active Paris Statistical Office regretted that the "results of their
effort were too often paralysed by the obstinate refusal of a notable part of the medical
profession".36 It was only in 1906 that all French doctors not without some reluctance,
accepted their responsibility to report cause of death.37 The Belgian system started in

based on site. It had 178 categories.

Dr Marc d'Espine's statistical nosology

1867 with 116 categories, but these were reduced to thirty-three in 1874, because of
problems of collection.38 Many English-speaking countries, among them the British
colonies, followed Farr, or his successor William Ogle's amended version.

In 1893 the matter of an international classification was again raised, this time in the
International Statistical Institute, an organization set up in 1885 to replace the
Congress which had collapsed seven years earlier. The proponents were the father and
son L. A. and J. Bertillon, working in the Paris Statistical Office. Although they did not
acknowledge it, Farr's system provided the basis of their proposal.39 The resulting
International Classification, now in its ninth revision, starts with "infectious and
parasitic diseases", moves to the "neoplasms" of all sites, and then groups diseases
entirely by site, thus firmly following Farr's original. Perhaps for this reason, Marc
d'Espine's nosology looks curiously clumsy and old-fashioned today.

APPENDIX A

MARC D'ESPINE'S EXPLICATION

Each symbol separated from the following one by a comma indicates a death. Its position
indicates the year and month when it took place and the accidental or morbid cause which
produced it. The symbols with a circumflex (eg. m.30) relate to deaths of inhabitants of the town
of Geneva: those without a circumflex to those of inhabitants of the rest of the Canton. The
number in the symbol designates the age of the deceased in years if no letter follows and in
months, weeks, days or hours if it is followed by the letters m, s, j or h. The letters m orf which
precede the number indicate the masculine or feminine sex and the letter r, which precedes the
letter indicating sex in some instances, means death of persons who had lived all their lives in
wealth or great affluence.

I must make it clear that the nomenclature of causes of death conforms in detail and as a whole
to that which was agreed at the International Congress at Paris. I have confined myself to
classifying the main divisions of types of morbidity according to the aetiological principles
whose adoption I proposed to Congress, but on which they did not wish to come to a definite
decision, postponing to the next session the adoption of a classification of fatal diseases. As it
stands the table lends itself to all statistical research on deaths which relates how conditions of
age, sex, seasonality, place of residence and degree of affluence or social position affect various
fatal diseases or accidents.

I therefore put forward my table as a specimen for reports on mortality in the various states
which have adopted the nomenclature of causes of death decreed at the Paris session. Its layout
combines clarity, accuracy and brevity with the advantage of allowing the derivation from the
report of all imaginable secondary tables. One can concentrate into a table of the present size the
annual deaths in a population of 150,000 souls. Belgium and Piedmont could include all their
annual deaths on twenty-five such sheets, Bavaria and Prussian on 100 sheets and France on 200,
and such tables would allow all desirable research without the necessity of going back to original
data. In this way the original facts are copied and laid out in a manner which concentrates them
in the smallest possible space and in an order which allows any part to be extracted with a great
economy of time.

The extraction of information from medical notes which has permitted the construction of
this table has been done with great care and after the examination of two reports given in each
case by the medical practitioner and a visiting doctor. My honourable colleague and friend
Doctor Duval has gladly carried out this extraction with me, and I take the opportunity of
expressing my gratitude.
