DAVID P. ADAMS, "The greatest good to the greatest number": penicillin rationing on the
American home front, 1940-1945, American University Studies, Series 9, History, vol. 93, New
York, Peter Lang, 1991, pp. viii, 227, ?22.00 (0-8204-1284-8).

When a new medicine is discovered and becomes known to the public, a great demand is
liable to arise more quickly than large scale manufacture can be got going. Sick people and

castigating their scandalous misconduct. There is little news value in the conscientious devotion
of men forced to decide how the few available doses can be used to cure and at the same time

for ranking the many claims, most of which cannot be met until the means of production have
been created and the trickle of supply turns into the desired flood.

The introduction of penicillin to the United States generated all these hazards. In the shadow
of the Statue of Liberty, to restrain individual rights to acquire a life-saving remedy was
anathema, and the problems of fair and beneficial distribution were particularly onerous. They
were met with great courage and coolness by responsible doctors and committees which
appointed and backed them. Doctor Adams has compiled a detailed and well documented
account of the crucial years, and of the implications when similar situations occur again.
