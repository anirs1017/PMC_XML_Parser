On the other hand, neovascularisation during embryonic development is distinguished from angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a complex process involving extracellular matrix (ECM) and vascular endothelial cells, and is regulated by various angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), transforming growth factor-&#x003b1; (TGF-&#x003b1;), and others (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These factors can promote cell proliferation, chemotactic migration, and capillary/tube-like network formation of vascular endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The endothelial-specific mitogen VEGF has been shown to be a key positive regulator of tumor angiogenesis including glioblastoma, colon, breast, renal, and other tumors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The ability to form a capillary/tube-like network is a specialized function of vascular endothelial cells. VEGF also promoted formation of a capillary-like network of vascular endothelial cells in various matrix gels such as collagen and fibronectin <italic>in vitro</italic>. The response of vascular endothelial cells to soluble angiogenic factors, as well as interactions between ECM and the cells were required for new blood vessel formation.</p><p>Integrin adhesion receptors are &#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that interact with the ECM and cytoplasmic molecules including cytoskeletal and catalytic signaling molecules (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that was initially identified as the integrin &#x003b2;1-tail-binding protein (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The C-terminal region of ILK exhibits significant homology to other protein kinase catalytic domains and ILK can phosphorylate protein substrates such as integrin &#x003b2;1 cytoplasmic region, Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been reported that integrins cooperate with the VEGF receptors to promote activation of an <italic>in vitro </italic>angiogenic program in vascular endothelial cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, ILK transduces signals affecting anti-apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and these are mediated by interactions between integrins and the ECM (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, so far no biological function of ILK in vascular endothelial cells has been demonstrated.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the effect of dominant-negative, kinase deficient ILK (ILK-KD) in the capillary/tube-like network formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We demonstrate a critical role for ILK in network formation by vascular endothelial cells in a collagen gel matrix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>

               </title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and were cultured in collagen-coated flasks (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in CS-C medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), according to the instructions of the supplier. Cells were passaged at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells from passage 3-7 were used for capillary/tube-like network formation assay on type I collagen gel matrix. RPMI-1640 medium was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) was purchased from R &#x00026; D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Type I collagen gel matrix (Cellmatrix type I-A) was from Nitta Gelatin Inc. (Osaka, Japan). LY294002, a selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor, was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>

               </title><p>We used a basic procedure. Briefly, extraction of cytoplasmic RNA from HUVEC was performed using TRIzol solution (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). The reverse transcription of RNA was performed in a reaction mixture containing total RNA, AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), oligo(dT)<sub>15</sub>, ribonuclease inhibitor, and each dNTP mixture. The mixture was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes, and then chilled at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. First strand cDNA (corresponding to 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA) was subjected to amplification using the forward primer 5'- GAG ACC CAA GCT TCT GGA TGG ACC TGG AAG CCT -3', the reverse primer 5'- GAT GAC GCG GCC GCT CAG GTG CCT TTG CTT TCT G -3' and high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). After an initial cycle of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, polymerase chain reaction was carried out for 25 cycles with the following cycle conditions: 95&#x000b0;C, 30 seconds; 55&#x000b0;C, 30 seconds; 72&#x000b0;C, 3 minutes with a postincubation of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The insert of recombinant plasmid, pcDNA3-ILK, was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequence analysis using ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>

               </title><p>Endothelial capillary/tube-like network formation was assessed using type I collagen gel matrix. Eight volumes of 0.3% Cellmatrix type I-A solution (Nitta Gelatin, Inc.) were mixed with one volume each of reconstituted buffer (4.77 g Hepes and 2.2 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in 100 ml of 0.05N NaOH) and RPMI-1640 and kept on ice. Then 150 &#x003bc;l aliquots of this reconstituted collagen solution were placed in each well of 48-well culture plates and immediately incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour to allow gel formation. After the gel solidified, HUVEC (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/0.3 ml) were added to well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for eight hours. Subsequently, each well was washed in PBS, fixed with 0.5 ml of 100% methanol for 20 minutes, and stained with Giemsa&#x02019;s solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at room temperature for 30 minutes. The formation of the capillary/tube-like networks were examined by using a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a Sony CCD video camera and evaluated by KS400 imaging system, release 2.0 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany). Once determined, the images were captured and exported to Photoshop (Adobe) or PowerPoint (Microsoft) for high-quality printing. All experiments were repeated at least twice.

                  <bold>Regression of capillary/tube-like network formation by ILK inhibition using a dominant negative ILK</bold>
               </title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that cellular responses to various growth factors, including VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), are modulated by the activation of integrin adhesion receptors. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic regions of integrins associate with catalytic signaling molecules such as ILK and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Our next experiment was designated to evaluate whether VEGF-induced formation of capillary/tube-like networks in a type I collagen gel matrix was mediated by ILK. A potent dominant negative, kinase-deficient form of ILK (ILK-KD) contains a point mutation substituting a lysine for the glutamic acid at position 359 in the kinase domain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As shown Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, ILK-KD could inhibit ILK kinase activity as a dominant negative. The N-terminal region of ILK contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain that probably binds a phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate, which is a lipid product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This domain is likely to participate in the regulation of ILK kinase activity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, LY294002, also inhibited kinase activity of ILK (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Inhibition of ILK kinase activity by ILK-KD or LY294002 in HUVEC.</title><p> The cells were stimulated with 30 ng/ml VEGF for 5 minutes, and then ILK activity was measured by ILK kinase assay.
