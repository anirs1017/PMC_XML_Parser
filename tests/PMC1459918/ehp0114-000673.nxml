We measured the levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine, micronucleated binucleated cells (BNMNs) in peripheral blood lymphocyte, and GST in serum. Our results showed that the group exposed to COEs had significantly increased levels of 1-OHP [median 5.7; interquartile range (IQR), 1.4&#x02013;12.0 &#x003bc;mol/mol creatinine] compared with the control group (3; 0.5&#x02013;6.4 &#x003bc;mol/mol creatinine). In addition, the median levels (IQR) of 8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST were markedly increased in the exposed [1.9 (1.4&#x02013;15.4) &#x003bc;mol/mol creatinine; 6 (2&#x02013;8) per thousand; 22.1 (14.9&#x02013;31.2) U/L, respectively] compared with controls [1.3 (1.0&#x02013;4.0) &#x003bc;mol/mol creatinine, 2 (0&#x02013;4) per thousand; and 13.1 (9.5&#x02013;16.7) U/L, respectively]. These results appeared to be modified by smoking. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to COEs had the highest odds ratio among variables analyzed and that smoking was not a significant confounder of the levels of studied biomarkers. Overall, the present findings suggest that COE exposure led to increased internal PAH burden, genetic damage, oxidative stress, and GST activity. The consequences of the changes in these biomarkers, such as risk of cancer, warrant further investigations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coke oven emissions</kwd><kwd>glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase</kwd><kwd>8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine</kwd><kwd>1-hydroxypyrene</kwd><kwd>micronuclei</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Coke oven emissions (COEs) are formed and released into the environment when coal is pyrolyzed into coke (<xref rid="b27-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">National Toxicology Program 2002</xref>).

For instance, 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) represents an important product from oxidative damage to DNA. 8-OHdG is formed in a promutagenic DNA lesion induced by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with guanosine at the C8 site in DNA (<xref rid="b17-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Kasai et al. 1986</xref>).

In addition, the activity of serum GST, a universal detoxifying enzyme present in the human body, was examined in these coke oven workers to explore possible modulation on GST activity by PAH exposure. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), a recognized biomarker of exposure to PAHs (primary constituents of COEs), was also investigated to estimate the internal burden of PAHs in this study population (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Jongeneelen 2001</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study populations and sample collection.</title><p>The study subjects were the coke oven workers in a steel plant in Taiyuan, northern China, where the workers are exposed to PAHs during the open-air coking process in their daily shift. Seventy-eight male workers selected from this coke oven plant were classified into two groups, COE-exposed and control, based on historic exposure data from mandatory regular air sample analysis. The exposed group consisted of 47 coke oven workers; 31 control subjects were workers of the distillery, maintenance sections, and offices in the same plant. The workers participating in the study had been employed for at least 10 years and were currently working in the coke oven plant. After providing their written informed consent to participate in this study, at enrollment all the individuals were interviewed; a questionnaire was used to elicit their health status, body weight and height, occupational history, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p><p>The one-time blood (2 mL each) and urine samples (20 mL each) were collected from subjects at the end of the work shift. Fresh blood lymphocyte cultures were carried out for the MN analysis. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for detection of GST activity. The urine samples were stored at &#x02212;28&#x000b0;C before being analyzed for 1-OHP and 8-OHdG.

(2003)</xref>. We used 2 mL urine from each sample for the detection assay, in which 0.5 mL of sodium hydroxide (15 mol/L) was added, and the samples were incubated at 100&#x000b0;C for 3 hr in the dark. Then, 50 &#x003bc;L carbazole (100 &#x003bc;g/mL) was added to each sample as the internal standard. The samples were adjusted to pH 3&#x02013;5 with hydrochloric acid (1 mol/L). Subsequently, 1-OHP was extracted from urine with 4 mL dichloromethane. The extracts were evaporated to dryness under vacuum before being dissolved in 0.3 mL HPLC solvent and analyzed by HPLC (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA). The separation of 1-OHP was achieved using a reverse-phase C18 column (Spherisorb ODS2, 4.6 mm &#x000d7; 250 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase used for isocratic elution of 1-OHP was composed of methanol and water (3:1). To quantify 1-OHP, we used a pump system (Varian-Prostar model 230; Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA), an autosampler (Varian-Prostar model 410), and a fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength 346 nm, emission wavelength 386 nm; Varian-Prostar model 360). Identification and quantification of 1-OHP were based on retention time and peak area measured using a linear regression curve obtained from internal standard solutions. The detection limit of urinary 1-OHP was 0.5 ng/mL; for measurements below 0.5 ng/mL, we used 0.35 ng/mL (70% of the detection limit) as the default. Urine 1-OHP concentrations were expressed as micromoles per mole creatinine.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of urinary 8-OHdG.</title><p>The cleanup treatment of urine and analysis of urinary 8-OHdG were carried out according to a method described by <xref rid="b10-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Germadnik et al.

Then, 2 mL supernatant was adsorbed twice on preconditioned cartridges (10 mL/500 mg; Bond Elut LRC C18 OH; Varian) and eluted twice with 50 mM potassium phosphate monobasic (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; pH 7.5) containing 15% and 20% methanol, respectively. Subsequently, the eluate was evaporated to remove methanol, supplemented by HPLC solvent to bring a final volume of 1.5 mL, and analyzed by an HPLC system with electrochemical detector (Varian-Prostar model 370; Varian) equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode operated at +0.8 V versus a silver/silver chloride reference electrode. The separation of 8-OHdG was carried out on a reverse-phase C18 column with 30&#x000b0;C column temperature. The mobile phase used for isocratic elution of 8-OHdG was composed of 50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 3.5), 1% methanol, 2.5% acetonitrile, 2 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, and the limit of detection of urinary 8-OHdG was 1 ng/mL. We quantified 8-OHdG in urine by the peak area of measurement using the linear regression curve for standard solutions of 3.5, 14, 56, and 224 nmol/L. For measurements below 1 ng/mL, we used 0.5 ng/mL, half of the detection limit, as the default.

Fresh blood lymphocyte cultures were set up by adding 0.5 mL whole blood to 4.5 mL RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (15%) and penicillin (100 IU/mL). Phytohemagglutinin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to lymphocyte cultures at a final concentration of 20 &#x003bc;g/mL. After 44 hr of incubation, cytochalasin-B (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 6 &#x003bc;g/mL to arrest cytokinesis.

However, the significant smoking-adjusted associations suggest that the internal exposure level of PAHs was due to external exposure, including both smoking and coke oven exposure, in the workers.</p><p>Urinary excretion of 8-OHdG, as the repair product from oxidative DNA modification by excision enzymes, is an <italic>in vivo</italic> measure of overall oxidative DNA damage (<xref rid="b8-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Cooke et al. 2000</xref>, <xref rid="b7-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and has often been used as a biomarker to assess the extent of oxidative DNA damage and repair in the occupational setting (<xref rid="b21-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Lagorio et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b29-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Pilger et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b32-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Tagesson et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b33-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Toraason et al. 2001</xref>). Although urinary 8-OHdG levels may be affected by renal impairment (<xref rid="b1-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Akagi et al. 2003</xref>), our participants had no reported history of kidney diseases, which was further confirmed by the normal results of their routine urine analysis at the time of the study. In the present study, the level of urinary 8-OHdG was much higher in coke oven workers than in control subjects. Although elevated 8-OHdG levels existed only in nonsmokers and not in smokers of the exposure group, further multivariate logistic regression analysis suggests that occupational exposure to COEs was associated with an increase but BMI was associated with a decrease in the levels of 8-OHdG after adjustment for age and smoking. BMI showed a significant effect on 8-OHdG excretions, which may be due to higher rate of metabolism in lean subjects with increased availability of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="b25-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Loft et al. 1992</xref>).</p><p>It is important to investigate the effect of occupational exposure to COEs on genotoxicity in coke oven workers. There was a significant increased frequency of BNMNs in smokers but not in nonsmokers among coke oven workers, when compared with control subjects. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both occupational exposure to COEs and age were risk factors of formation of MNs in the workers we studied. The same levels of association of occupational exposure and age with the MN formation suggest that they were equally important risk factors. The present finding implies that age as a time-dependent variable should be carefully considered and controlled in similar epidemiologic studies of environmental exposure using MNs as a biomarker.</p><p>As an important detoxification enzyme, GST plays a major role in protecting individuals from PAH-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (<xref rid="b26-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima et al. 1995</xref>). In the present study, serum GST activity in coke oven workers was much higher than that of controls. Because GST serves as a phase II enzyme in detoxifying xenobiotics and keeping intracellular redox balance in the presence of its substrates, the increase of GST activity in coke oven workers may represent adaptation or defense against the burden of mutagens and carcinogens in the human body. Occupational exposure is a significant risk factor revealed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, the other two factors we studied, aging and smoking, were not significant. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between GST activity and PAH exposure based on urinary 1-OHP levels. Additionally, correlation analysis also revealed a significant positive correlation between GST and BNMNs, indicating coherence of toxicity response to PAH exposure. It is widely recognized that GST polymorphisms potentially contribute to individual susceptibility to carcinogen-induced biomarkers of exposure and effect (<xref rid="b36-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Wormhoudt et al. 1999</xref>). Indeed, <xref rid="b23-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al. (2004b)</xref> demonstrated that the frequency of MNs was lower in coke oven workers with a nonnull glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase mu-1 (<italic>GSTM1</italic>) genotype than in those with the null <italic>GSTM1</italic> genotype in a steel company in northeastern China. Hence, influence on MN formation by GST polymorphism should be taken into account in future studies. Taken together, GST should be considered a possible indicator for monitoring PAH exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to estimate the relationship between individual serum GST activity and occupational exposure to PAHs.</p><p>As for the correlations among 1-OHP, 8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST, the 1-OHP concentrations were not significantly correlated with 8-OHdG levels or BNMN frequency in all subjects, suggesting that these markers may have different specificities. It is well known that in, addition to PAHs, COEs also contain a variety of nitrosamines, coal tar, metals compounds, and so forth. These cocontaminants derived from COEs may also contribute to the levels of urinary 8-OHdG and lymphocytic MNs (<xref rid="b18-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b28-ehp0114-000673" ref-type="bibr">Palus et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we simultaneously investigated levels of PAH exposure, cytogenetic damage, oxidative stress, and enzyme activity change induced in workers exposed to COEs. Our data suggest that urinary 1-OHP and serum GST might be regarded as biomarkers of PAH exposure and that urinary 8-OHdG and lymphocytic MNs could be used as parameters to reflect occupational health effects in coke oven workers. However, confounding factors, such as BMI and age, may influence the assessment of biologic effects of occupational COE exposure. Overall, the present study provides some new clues in developing biomarkers in biomonitoring and early prevention of health effects associated with occupational exposure to COEs, including genotoxicity burden and subsequent cancer risk.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We thank Q.
